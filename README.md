### Problem

Many testnet faucets ask you to hold or spend mainnet ETH (or other tokens) before you can get testnet funds. For early users—students, builders who haven’t earned much yet—that’s a real barrier. You want to learn and build on Base, but you can’t get testnet ETH without money you don’t have.

### What Pipette does

**Pipette** is a faucet for **Base Sepolia** testnet ETH that doesn’t require mainnet funds. You get testnet ETH so you can build and try apps on Base without spending real money.

Connect your wallet, link your GitHub account, and claim when you need it. How much you can claim depends on a simple score (e.g. verified email, GitHub link, wallet age) so the faucet can serve many people fairly. No sign-up beyond wallet and optional GitHub.
